Add #include "mymods.h" at the bottom of the include list
At the bottom of the process_record_user() function (bottom of the file)
replace "return true;" with "return process_record_custom(keycode, record);"

If you change the base repo, you may also need to add
KEY_OVERRIDE_ENABLE = yes
to the rules.mk file in the moonlander folder
and
#DEFINE AUDIO_INIT_DELAY
to the config.h folder if you want startup sounds to work
